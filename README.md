# spaghetti by Michael Jacob<br><a href="https://github.com/Michaelleojacob/spaghetti" target="_blank">Repository</a> <br><a href="https://michaelleojacob.github.io/spaghetti/" target="_blank">Live application</a>

# How to use:<br>Click on the >Live application< above. Once you open the page, click on the input which will say "name" and and type whatever you like into the input field. Click the add button or press enter on the keyboard to add that input to the array, and the page!

# Built with:<br> vanilla javascript<br>html<br>css

# High Priority on:<br>Simple and sleek design<br>Mobile first focus<br>Dark mode

# Highlight features:<br>Three different js files, which all do the same logic.<br>GhostShip.js (default) directly shows dom elements to the page using the people.people array. If I delete or add to the array, the dom is updated to display that change.<br>Main.js features single target adding and single target deleting. The Main.js file does not have to recreate the elements on the page every time an update is made. It simple just removes or addes a single item. Whereas ghostship recreates every array item every time a change is made.<br>Script.js is spaghetti code. No IIFE(iffy), code is all just posted to the window. It's not as easy to read. It's kinda sloppy. But it works. Script.js was my baseline going into the modular version of code.

# Future additions:<br>Make app prettier.<br>Possibly adding more features.<br>Futher increasing the modular design(?)
